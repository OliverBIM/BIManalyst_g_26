# A5: Reflection on Course Concepts and OpenBIM

## Learning Experience for the Concept Focused On

### Initial and Final Skill Levels
At the beginning of the course, 41934, the general understanding and knowledge of OpenBIM concepts and tools was at a **Beginner Level**. Although having thorough knowledge of BIM tools (AutoCAD, Revit, Blender, etc.), the concepts of extracting data using IfcOpenShell were not known.

### Other Concepts to Further Develop
- **Advanced IFC Customization:** Extending the IFC schema to meet specific project needs.
- **Automation:** Using scripting tools like Python for automated data extraction and manipulation within IFC files.
- **Collaboration Workflows:** Learning more about OpenBIM in multidisciplinary coordination for complex projects.
- **Advanced Visualization:** Leveraging OpenBIM tools for immersive visualization and real-time project updates.

### Future Use of OpenBIM
- **Real-World Application:** We aim to use OpenBIM for streamlining project workflows, extracting and validating data from stakeholders, and perhaps developing simple beam calculation scripts.
- **Research and Innovation:** OpenBIM could form a core aspect of thesis work or future studies on BIM interoperability and sustainability in architecture and construction.
- **Long-Term Adoption:** OpenBIM's broad scale and open standards make it relevant for the future, and we look forward to seeing its further implementation.

## Group 26's Process of Developing the Tutorial

### Course Insights for Thesis
The course’s focus on hands-on tool use and practical applications enabled us to develop research questions that could be implemented in a thesis. If working on a thesis involving structural analysis, the course has taught us the fundamentals of how to address the problems.

### Preferences for Use Cases
The broad range of use case options made our group reflect on how and where a tool could be needed in the engineering industry. While a more guided approach is easier to follow and builds more confidence in OpenBIM, the broad range of use cases forces us to reflect individually.

### Number of Tools
The selection of tools was appropriate for the course. A few suggestions:
- For the coding of our use case, it could be helpful to have either YouTube videos with the basics of Python functions in relation to IfcOpenShell. Most of the coding was self-taught.
- Introducing more code examples with different purposes, perhaps as part of the lectures.

## Group Feedback Summary

### Tutorial Feedback
The tutorial feedback given focused on the simplicity and clarity of the end-user experience. The following points can be highlighted:
1. **Clarity and Simplicity:** To make the end-user experience simpler, parts of the code, such as where the "file_destination" or the current repository is computed, were moved to the top and highlighted.
2. **High Level of Coding and Relevance:** The tool was considered of high standard since it demonstrated extracting data, validating it, and then performing automated calculations and visualizations.
3. **The Tutorial in Summary:** It provides the end-user with a clear indication of the purpose and format of the tool's functions.

### Addressing the Use Case
Yes, the tools and methods employed during the tutorial successfully demonstrated the application of OpenBIM concepts in solving the use case.

## Individual Reflection on Future Use of OpenBIM: Frederik Højsager: s195392

### Future Use in Thesis
OpenBIM tools have a clearly stated relevance in architecture and structural analysis. If a future thesis consists of a case where OpenBIM can be applied, it would be of much interest.  
**As an example:** The structural analysis of a multi-story building in the context of a sudden collapse of a seemingly non-critical beam. This scenario could examine how the failure of one beam might propagate and affect the overall stability of the structure. The IFC model serves as a central tool for the investigation, providing a detailed digital representation of the structural system. OpenBIM tools can also be used to visualize critical beams or isolate key structural components.

This thesis would focus on the technical applications of OpenBIM and also demonstrate its role in fostering collaboration and ensuring accurate analysis in structural scenarios.

### Professional Applications
From the lectures by external professionals, it is clear how OpenBIM tools are growing both in demand and relevance. It is therefore highly likely that they will feature prominently in the next decades.
