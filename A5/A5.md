# A5: Reflection on course concepts and OpenBIM

## Learning experience for the concept focused on

### Initial and Final Skill Levels
At the beginning of the the course, 41934, the general understanding and knowledge of the OpenBIM concepts and tools was a t a **Beginner Level**. Although having thourough knowledge on BIM (Autocad, Revit, Blender etc), the concepts of extracting data with ifcopenshell was not known. 

### Other concepts to further develop
- **Advanced IFC Customization:** Extending IFC schema to meet specific project needs.
- **Automation:** Using scripting tools like Python for automated data extraction and manipulation within IFC files.
- **Collaboration Workflows:** Learning more about OpenBIM in multi-disciplinary coordination for complex projects.
- **Advanced Visualization:** Leveraging OpenBIM tools for immersive visualization and real-time project updates.

### Future Use of OpenBIM
- **Real world application:** We seek to use OpenBIM for streamlining project workflows, extracting and validating data from stakeholders and perpahs develop simple beam calculating scripts.
- **Research and Innovation:** OpenBIM could form a core aspect of thesis work or future studies on BIM interoperability and sustainability in architecture and construction.
- **Long-Term Adoption:** OpenBIM's borad scale and open standards makes it relevant for the future, and we look forward to seeing its further implementation. 

## Group 26's process of developing the tutorial

### Course Insights for Thesis
The course’s focus on hands-on tool use and practical applications enabled me to research questions that could be implemented in a thesis. If working with a thesis of structural analysis, the course has taught us the fundementals of how to adress the problems. 

### Preferences for Use Cases
The broad range of use case options made our group reflect on how and where a tool could be needed in the engineering industry. While a more guided approach is easier to approach and builds more confidence in OpenBIM, the broad range of use case simply forces us to reflect individuelly. 

### Number of Tools
The selection of tools was appropriate for the course. A few suggestions:
- For the coding of our use-case, it could be helpfull to have either Youtube videos with the basics of python-function in regards to ifcOpenshell. All coding was more or less self-taught.
- Introducing more codes with different purposes. Perhaps as a part of the lectures. 

## Group Feedback Summary

### Tutorial Feedback
The tutorial feedback given was focused on the simplicity and clarity of the end-user. The following points can be highlights:
1. **Clarity and Simplicity:** In order to make the end-user experience more simpel, the parts of the code, where the computes for example the "file_destination" or the current repository, was moved to the top and highlighted.
2. **High Level of coding and relevance** The tool was considered of high standard, since it demonstrates extracting data, validating and then perform automated calculation and visualizations. 
3. **The tutorial in summary** Gives the end-user at clear indication of the purpose and format of the tools functions. 

### Addressing the Use Case
Yes, the tools and methods employed during the tutorial successfully demonstrated the application of OpenBIM concepts in solving the use case.

## Iniduvual Reflectoin on Future use of OpenBIM: Frederik Højsager: s195392

### Future use in thesis
OpenBIM tools have a clearly stated relevance in architecture and structurual analysis. If a future thesis consists of a case where OpenBIM can be applied, it would be of much interest. 
**As an example:** The structural analysis of a multi-story building in the context of a sudden collapse of a seemingly non-critical beam. This scenario could examine how the failure of one beam might propagate and affect the overall stability of the structure. The IFC model serves as a central tool for the investigation, providing a detailed digital representation of the structural system. OpenBIM tools can also be used to visualize critical beams or isolating key structural compenents. 

This thesis would be of tehcincal applications of openBIM and also demonstrate its role in fostering collaboration and ensuring accurate analysis in structural scenarios. 

### Professional Applications
From the lectures from extern proffesionals, in is clearly seen how OpenBIM tools are growing both in demamd, but also relevance. It is therefore heighly likely to feature in the next decades.
