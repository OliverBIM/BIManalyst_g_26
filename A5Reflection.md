# A5: Reflection on Course Concepts and OpenBIM

## Learning Experience for the Concept Focused On

At the start of course 41934, our collective understanding of OpenBIM concepts and tools was at a beginner level. While we had some limited experience using coding in BIM projects, we had not previously worked with tools designed to extract data from a model. While we have already tried some BIM tools such as AutoCAD, Revit, and other CAD programs, we lacked experience with extracting data using IfcOpenShell. The idea of learning how to use IfcOpenShell to extract data from IFC files initially seemed a little hard because we were completely new to this. However, with time and the support of detailed resources provided on DTU Learn (GitHub), we were able to overcome this challenge. These resources not only guided us through the process but also enabled us to build on previously developed solutions from the course. By integrating these insights, we successfully developed our own approach to OpenBIM, enhancing our understanding and application of its principles and tools.

In the world of OpenBIM, we recognize that we still have much to learn, as this course marks our first experience with OpenBIM tools. In the future, we are particularly interested in exploring how to automate certain processes in the design phase using scripting. Additionally, leveraging OpenBIM to create visualizations for various aspects of a project is another area we would like to delve into further.

## Group 26's Process of Developing the Tutorial

To be honest, one member of our group has considered using OpenBIM for their thesis, which makes this question somewhat challenging to answer collectively. However, if we were to pursue OpenBIM in our thesis, this course would play a crucial role in that process. The freedom offered in this course, along with the opportunity to learn from the tools developed by other groups, makes it highly valuable. It allows for a flexible approach to OpenBIM, enabling us to adapt and tailor its use to fit our specific needs and objectives.
