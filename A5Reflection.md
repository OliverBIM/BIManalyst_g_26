# A5: Reflection on Course Concepts and OpenBIM

## Learning Experience for the Concept Focused On

At the start of course 41934, our collective understanding of OpenBIM concepts and tools was at a beginner level. While we had some limited experience using coding in BIM projects, we had not previously worked with tools designed to extract data from a model. While we have already tried some BIM tools such as AutoCAD, Revit, and other CAD programs, we lacked experience with extracting data using IfcOpenShell. The idea of learning how to use IfcOpenShell to extract data from IFC files initially seemed a little hard because we were completely new to this. However, with time and the support of detailed resources provided on DTU Learn (GitHub), we were able to overcome this challenge. These resources not only guided us through the process but also enabled us to build on previously developed solutions from the course. By integrating these insights, we successfully developed our own approach to OpenBIM, enhancing our understanding and application of its principles and tools.

In the world of OpenBIM, we recognize that we still have much to learn, as this course marks our first experience with OpenBIM tools. In the future, we are particularly interested in exploring how to automate certain processes in the design phase using scripting. Additionally, leveraging OpenBIM to create visualizations for various aspects of a project is another area we would like to delve into further.

## Group 26's Process of Developing the Tutorial

To be honest, one member of our group has considered using OpenBIM for their thesis, which makes this question somewhat challenging to answer collectively. However, if we were to pursue OpenBIM in our thesis, this course would play a crucial role in that process. The freedom offered in this course, along with the opportunity to learn from the tools developed by other groups, makes it highly valuable. It allows for a flexible approach to OpenBIM, enabling us to adapt and tailor its use to fit our specific needs and objectives.

The previous response has already touched on this aspect of the reflection regarding whether we would prefer having less freedom of choice. As mentioned earlier, we believe that the freedom provided in this course is one of its greatest strengths. It allows us to explore a wide range of tools and encourages creative problem-solving, making the course incredibly valuable. Additionally, it’s exciting to see how the development of these tools will continue to evolve with future classes. We feel fortunate to have benefited from the contributions of past students, whose ideas and tools have provided us with inspiration and guidance.

## Group Feedback Summary

### Tutorial Feedback
The tutorial feedback given focused on the simplicity and clarity of the end-user experience. The following points can be highlighted:
1. **Clarity and Simplicity:** To make the end-user experience simpler, parts of the code, such as where the "file_destination" or the current repository is computed, were moved to the top and highlighted.
2. **High Level of Coding and Relevance:** The tool was considered of high standard since it demonstrated extracting data, validating it, and then performing automated calculations and visualizations.
3. **The Tutorial in Summary:** It provides the end-user with a clear indication of the purpose and format of the tool's functions.

### Addressing the Use Case
Yes, the tools and methods employed during the tutorial successfully demonstrated the application of OpenBIM concepts in solving the use case.

### Future Use in Thesis
OpenBIM tools have a clearly stated relevance in architecture and structural analysis. If a future thesis consists of a case where OpenBIM can be applied, it would be of much interest.  
**As an example:** The structural analysis of a multi-story building in the context of a sudden collapse of a seemingly non-critical beam. This scenario could examine how the failure of one beam might propagate and affect the overall stability of the structure. The IFC model serves as a central tool for the investigation, providing a detailed digital representation of the structural system. OpenBIM tools can also be used to visualize critical beams or isolate key structural components.

This thesis would focus on the technical applications of OpenBIM and also demonstrate its role in fostering collaboration and ensuring accurate analysis in structural scenarios.

### Professional Applications
From the lectures by external professionals, it is clear how OpenBIM tools are growing both in demand and relevance. It is therefore highly likely that they will feature prominently in the next decades.
