# A4 - Teach

## Description
For our A4 assignment, we created a video that provides a detailed explanation of the concept behind our tool from A3. The video offers a clear overview of the target audience for the tool and its functionality. The tool aims to automate the process of collecting data on structural elements' dimensions and quantity, providing early cost estimates to stakeholders and contractors. This will help in verifying design details, ensuring compliance, and facilitating accurate project cost projections.

If you're looking for a more comprehensive tutorial on how to run the script and use the tool, we recommend referring to the markdown file included in A3.
